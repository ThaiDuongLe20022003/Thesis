    "query": "what is The Human Authorship Requirement ?",
    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out what the Human Authorship Requirement is based on the provided documents. Let me start by looking through the context information given.\n\nThe first document mentions that the U.S. Copyright Office will register an original work of authorship if it was created by a human being. It also quotes some legal cases, like Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony, which emphasize that copyright protects original intellectual conceptions of the author. The key point here seems to be that the work must be created by a human, not a machine or nature.\n\nAnother part from document 313.2 talks about works that lack human authorship, such as those created by animals, plants, or natural processes. The example given is a photo taken by a monkey, which isn't copyrightable. This reinforces that human involvement is necessary.\n\nIn the section about copyrightable subject matter, it's mentioned that the work must be created by a human, and examples of non-human creation are listed. Also, there's a part discussing computer-generated works, where the question is whether the human author provided the creative elements or if the machine did. The Office would refuse registration if the machine, not the human, conceived the work.\n\nPutting this together, the Human Authorship Requirement is the legal principle that for a work to be eligible for copyright registration in the U.S., it must be created by a human being. This requirement excludes works produced by nature, animals, or machines without human input. The human must be the source of the original creative expression, even if they use tools or technology to assist in the creation process.\n</think>\n\nThe **Human Authorship Requirement** is a legal principle established by the U.S. Copyright Office, which mandates that for a work to be eligible for copyright registration, it must be **created by a human being**. This requirement is rooted in U.S. copyright law, which protects only \"original works of authorship\" ...",
